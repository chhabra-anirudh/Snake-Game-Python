# Snake Game using Python Turtle

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, developed using Python's Turtle module. It was originally created in April 2023 during my high school years (Grade 10/11). This project highlights fundamental concepts of game development, including dynamic gameplay, collision detection, and efficient design.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows as it eats food, and the game speed increases with each successful action.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks the current score and the high score, displayed above the game area.
- **Customizable Design**: The game area is visually bordered, and the snake and food are styled using Python's Turtle graphics.

## How to Run
To run the game on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chhabra-anirudh/Snake-Game-Python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Snake-Game-Python
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake in the respective direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Project Timeline
- **Initial Development**: April 2023 (High School, Grade 10/11).
- **Improvements for Showcase**: January 2025.
